# 🌱 SmartAgro – AI-Powered Crop Recommendation System

## 📖 Overview

SmartAgro is an **AI-driven crop recommendation system** that helps farmers and researchers identify the most suitable crop for cultivation based on soil nutrients (NPK values), climatic conditions (temperature, humidity, rainfall), and geographic location.

The project combines a **Next.js frontend** with an integrated **Python machine learning model** (trained using scikit-learn). Users can input their **state, season, and previous crop**, and receive personalized crop recommendations powered by data and AI.

## 🔄 Technical Workflow

1. *User Input* – User provides inputs such as *state, season, previous crop, and optionally **plant images* (for disease identification).

2. *Frontend (Next.js)* – Handles UI for crop, disease, and fertilizer modules. Sends requests to API routes when the user triggers predictions or uploads images.

3. *API Routes* – Each feature has its own API endpoint (e.g., /api/recommend-crop, /api/disease-detect, /api/recommend-fertilizer). The API routes act as a bridge between the frontend and Python ML models.

4. *Python ML Scripts* –

   * mainfn.py: Handles *crop recommendation* using climate + NPK data + ML model.
   * disease_model.py (or equivalent): Handles *disease identification* by processing plant images and classifying diseases.
   * fertilizer.py: Handles *fertilizer recommendation* based on soil nutrient imbalance.

5. *Data Sources* –

   * *Datasets*: datasets/state_wise_npk_values.csv for soil data
   * *Models*: crop_model.pkl for crop prediction, additional models for disease and fertilizer tasks

6. *Recommendation Engine* – Each Python module returns structured results (predicted crop, disease status, fertilizer advice).

7. *API Response → Frontend* – Results are sent back as JSON and displayed dynamically on the frontend UI.
